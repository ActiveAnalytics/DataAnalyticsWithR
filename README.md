## Course Introduction

Welcome to the Data Analytics with R course with NobelProg. The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to the R programming language . It covers language fundamentals, working with data structures and file i/o, and includes basic concepts in working with data visualization and data analysis.

The schedule for the course outline is given below. The course is very interactive and includes many practical exercises throughout.
